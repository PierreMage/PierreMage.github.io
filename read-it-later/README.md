## Usage

### Adding Articles

1. Enter a URL in the "Article URL" field
2. **Automatic Title**: When you move to the next field, the app will try to fetch the article title automatically
3. Optionally provide a custom title (overrides the auto-fetched title)
4. Add tags separated by commas (e.g., "javascript, tutorial, web development")
5. Click "Save Article" to add it to your list

**URL Format**: The application accepts URLs with or without the `https://` protocol. If no protocol is provided, `https://` will be automatically added.

**Title Extraction**: The app uses multiple strategies to automatically fetch article titles:
1. **CORS Proxy Services**: Attempts to use free proxy services to bypass CORS restrictions
2. **Direct Fetch**: Tries direct access (works for sites that allow CORS)
3. **Smart URL Analysis**: Generates intelligent titles from URL structure for sites like Wikipedia, GitHub, Stack Overflow, etc.

**Note**: Due to browser security (CORS), many websites block automatic title fetching. The app handles this gracefully by using alternative methods or generating titles from the URL structure.

### Managing Articles

- **Edit Articles**: Click the "Edit" button to modify article title and tags in a modal dialog
- **Mark as Read/Unread**: Click the "Mark Read" or "Mark Unread" button on any article
- **Delete Articles**: Click the "Delete" button and confirm the action, or use "Delete All" to remove all articles
- **Search**: Use the search box to find articles by title, URL, or tag names
- **Filter**: Use the filter tabs to show all articles, only unread, or only archived articles
- **Tag Navigation**: Click on any tag to search for articles with that tag

### Import/Export

#### Importing from Pocket

1. Export your data from Pocket (getpocket.com) in CSV format
2. Click the "Import CSV" button in the application
3. Select your Pocket CSV file
4. Review the import summary showing imported, skipped, and error counts

**Supported Format**: The application supports the standard Pocket CSV export format with columns: `title`, `url`, `time_added`, `tags`, `status`

**Duplicate Handling**: Articles with duplicate URLs will be automatically skipped during import

#### Exporting Your Data

1. Click the "Export CSV" button
2. Your articles will be downloaded as a CSV file compatible with Pocket
3. The exported file includes all article data: titles, URLs, timestamps, tags, and read status

**File Format**: Exported files use the same CSV format as Pocket exports, ensuring compatibility for re-importing or transferring to other applications

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Ctrl/Cmd + F**: Focus the search input
- **Ctrl/Cmd + N**: Focus the URL input for adding new articles
- **Escape**: Close any open notification messages

## Technical Details

### Browser Compatibility

- **Modern Browsers**: Chrome 60+, Firefox 55+, Safari 12+, Edge 79+
- **Mobile Browsers**: iOS Safari 12+, Chrome Mobile 60+
- **Required Features**: localStorage, ES6 features (arrow functions, const/let, template literals)

### Storage

Articles are stored locally in your browser using `localStorage`. This means:
- Articles persist between browser sessions
- Data is stored locally on your device only
- No data is sent to external servers
- Clearing browser data will remove saved articles

### File Structure

### Key Components

1. **App Object**: Main application controller

4. Update this documentation

## Browser Support Notes

### localStorage

The application requires localStorage support. If localStorage is not available:
- A warning message will be displayed
- Articles will not persist between sessions
- All other functionality remains available

### Modern JavaScript Features

The code uses ES6+ features including:
- Arrow functions
- Template literals
- const/let declarations
- Destructuring assignment

For older browser support, consider transpiling with Babel.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Articles not saving**: 
- Check if localStorage is enabled in your browser
- Ensure you haven't exceeded the storage quota (usually 5-10MB)

**URL validation errors**:
- Ensure URLs include a valid domain name
- Only HTTP and HTTPS protocols are supported

**Search not working**:
- Search is case-insensitive and matches both titles and URLs
- Clear the search field to see all articles

**Title extraction not working**:
- This is normal behavior due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions
- Most websites block automatic title fetching for security reasons
- The app will automatically generate a title from the URL structure
- You can always manually enter a custom title

### Storage Limits

localStorage has size limits (typically 5-10MB per domain). If you reach this limit:
- Delete older articles you no longer need
- The application will show a warning when storage is full
